The Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It is a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. For many years, this cipher was believed to be unbreakable and was known as "le chiffre ind√©chiffrable" (French for "the indecipherable cipher"). Understanding the Vigenere cipher involves grasping a few key concepts. First, there is the plaintext, which is the original message. Second, a keyword is chosen by the sender and receiver. This keyword determines the sequence of Caesar cipher shifts. For example, if the keyword is "LEMON", the first letter of the plaintext is shifted by 'L' (11), the second by 'E' (4), the third by 'M' (12), the fourth by 'O' (14), and the fifth by 'N' (13). Then, the pattern repeats. The strength of the Vigenere cipher comes from its use of multiple Caesar ciphers. Unlike a simple Caesar cipher, where a frequency analysis of the ciphertext can quickly reveal the single shift, the Vigenere cipher distributes the letter frequencies, making such an analysis more complex. However, it is not immune. Methods like the Kasiski examination and Friedman test can be used to determine the key length. Once the key length is known, the ciphertext can be treated as several interleaved Caesar ciphers, each of which can be broken by frequency analysis. This makes it an interesting case study in classical cryptography, illustrating a significant step up from monoalphabetic ciphers but still vulnerable to more sophisticated cryptanalysis techniques. The challenge lies in identifying the repeating key.
